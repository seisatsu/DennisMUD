USAGE = "recover [<username> [<code> <newpass>]]"
DESCRIPTION = """Use your recovery code to change your password, or see the current code.

If you get locked out of your account, you can change your password without logging in.
This requires the recovery code you were given when you registered an account.
If you have lost the code as well, you will need to contact this server's administrator.
If there are no arguments, and you are logged in, just show the current recovery code.
Changing the password will also change the recovery code.
Wizards can retrieve any user's recovery code by providing their username as the only argument.

Ex. `recover seisatsu 847630 myn3wp4ssw0rd`"""
