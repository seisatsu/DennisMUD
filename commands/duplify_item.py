NAME = "duplify item"
CATEGORIES = ["items"]
USAGE = "duplify item <item_id>"
DESCRIPTION = """Duplify the item with <item_id>, so that any number of people can pick it up.

When a user besides the owner `get`s a duplified item, it doesn't disappear from the room it is in.
Any number of users may be holding the duplified item.
When the owner uses `break item` on a duplified item, all copies will break.
When a user besides the owner drops a duplified item, it will vanish.
Duplified items exist permanently in the owner's inventory until broken, and can be dropped in multiple places.
This feature is particularly useful for keys.
You can undo this with the `unduplify item` command.
You must own the item and it must be in your inventory in order to duplify it.
Wizards can duplify any item.

Ex. `duplify item 4`"""
