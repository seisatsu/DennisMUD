DESCRIPTION = """Set the description of the exit <exit_id> in this room.

A double backslash inserts a newline. Two sets of double backslashes make a paragraph break.
You may have any number of newlines, but you cannot stack more than two together.
You must own the exit or its room in order to describe it.
Wizards can describe any exit.

Ex. `describe exit 3 You see a lovely wooden door.`
Ex2. `describe exit 3 You see a lovely wooden door.\\\\The handle is made of brass.`
Ex3. `describe exit 3 You see a lovely wooden door.\\\\\\\\The handle is made of brass.`"""
