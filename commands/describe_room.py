DESCRIPTION = """Set the description of the room you are in.

A double backslash inserts a newline. Two sets of double backslashes make a paragraph break.
You may have any number of newlines, but you cannot stack more than two together.
You must own the room in order to describe it.
Wizards can describe any room.

Ex. `describe room 5 You are standing in a long, dark hallway.`
Ex2. `describe room 5 You are standing in a long, dark hallway.\\\\You cannot see the end.`
Ex3. `describe room 5 You are standing in a long, dark hallway.\\\\\\\\You cannot see the end.`"""
