NAME = "pair telekey"
CATEGORIES = ["rooms", "items"]
USAGE = "pair telekey <item_id> <room_id>"
DESCRIPTION = """Make the item <item_id> teleport its user to the room <room_id> when used.

You must own and be holding the item to pair it.
The destination room must be inbound unsealed, or you must be a room owner.
Any user who uses the item will teleport to the paired room.
Wizards may pair any telekey item to any room.

Ex. `pair telekey 3 5` to make item 3 teleport the user to room 5."""
