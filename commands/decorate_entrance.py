NAME = "decorate entrance"
CATEGORIES = ["actions", "exits"]
USAGE = "decorate entrance <exit_id> <action>"
DESCRIPTION = """Set a custom <action> to broadcast when a player enters the next room through the exit <exit_id>.

Everyone in the destination room will see the action text when it is broadcast.
By default, the action text is shown following the player's nickname and one space.
If the action starts with 's then the space is removed to allow possessive grammar.
To place the player's name elsewhere in the text, use the "%player%" marker.
To just message the player and not include their name, start the text with "%noaction%".
The tags "%they%", "%them%", "%their%", "%theirs%", and "%themselves%" will substitute pronouns.
The pronouns substituted will depend on the player's pronoun setting. See `set pronouns`.
The "%s%" tag will be removed for neutral pronouns, and otherwise replaced with the letter "s".
You must own the exit or its room in order to decorate its entrance.
You can remove the custom action from an entrance with the `undecorate entrance` command.
Wizards can decorate any exit.

Ex. `decorate entrance 3 fell in through the ceiling.`
Ex2. `decorate entrance 3 The ceiling spits out %player%.`"""
