CATEGORIES = ["items", "users"]
USAGE = "give <username> <item>"
DESCRIPTION = """Give the item called <item> to the user <username>.

You may use a full or partial item name and username. Also works by item ID.
The item must be in your inventory, and the recipient must be online and in the same room as you.
Wizards can give any item they are holding to any user anywhere, even an offline one.

Ex. `give seisatsu jar of dirt`
Ex2. `give seisatsu 4`"""
