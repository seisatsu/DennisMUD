NAME = "unduplify item"
CATEGORIES = ["items"]
USAGE = "unduplify item <item_id>"
DESCRIPTION = """Unduplify the item <item_id>, so that it can only be in one place at a time.

This undoes duplifying an item via the `duplify item` command.
You must own the item and it must be in your inventory in order to unduplify it.
All copies of the item in other users' inventories will disappear.
Wizards can unduplify any item from anywhere, and it will appear in their inventory if not there already.

Ex. `duplify item 4`"""
