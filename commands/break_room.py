USAGE = "break room <room_id>"
DESCRIPTION = """Break the room with ID <room_id>.

You must be an owner of the room, and no one can be in the room, including yourself.
Offline users will go to room 0 upon login. Items in the room will return to their primary owners.
Wizards can break any room.

Ex. `break room 5` to break the room with ID 5."""
