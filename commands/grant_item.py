USAGE = "grant item <item_id> <username>"
DESCRIPTION = """Add the user <username> to the owners of item <item_id>.

You must type the full username.
You must own the item and it must be in your inventory in order to grant it to another user.
You will also retain ownership of the item.
You can revoke ownership with the `revoke item` command, provided you are an owner.
Wizards can grant any item to anyone from anywhere.

Ex. `grant item 4 seisatsu`"""
