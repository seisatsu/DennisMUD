NAME = "sit"
CATEGORIES = ["actions", "settings", "users"]
ALIASES = ["sit down", "sit on", "sit down on"]
USAGE = "sit [item_name]"
DESCRIPTION = """Sit down, on the ground or on the item [item_name].

This will perform an action and modify your description to let other players know you are sitting down.
You can stand back up by using `stand` or by using `sit` a second time. You may also `lay`.
If an item is given, you will sit down on that item. Otherwise you will just sit down.
You cannot sit down on an item that is in your inventory; it must be in the room.
The modification to your description is affected by your pronouns; see `set pronouns`.

Ex. `sit`
Ex2. `sit down`
Ex3. `sit on carpet`
Ex4. `sit down on carpet`"""
