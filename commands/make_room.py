NAME = "make room"
CATEGORIES = ["rooms"]
ALIASES = ["create room", "new room"]
USAGE = "make room <room_name>"
DESCRIPTION = """Create a new room called <room_name>.

You will be added as an owner of the new room.

After making a room, you will need to make an exit to another room that leads to your new room, in order to make it accessible.
See the `make exit` command.

You also probably want to add a description that players will see when looking at your room.
See the `describe room` command.

You may also want to change the text that is broadcast when a player enters your room.
See the `actionate entrance` command.

Ex. `make room Small Bedroom`"""
