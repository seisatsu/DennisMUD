NAME = "set chat"
CATEGORIES = ["messaging", "settings"]
USAGE = "set chat [on|off]"
DESCRIPTION = """Check, enable, or disable the general chat setting.

If enabled, you will be able to send and receive general chat messages.
Chat messages are separate from private messages and same-room communication.
Everyone signed in with chat enabled will see all chat messages from everywhere.
To ignore a particular user's chat messages, see the `ignore user` command.

Ex. `set chat on` to enable the general chat."""
